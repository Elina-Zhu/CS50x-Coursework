Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: The predictions with 10, 100, 1000 and 10000 simulations.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: It seems like the predictions stabilized after 100000 simulations.
